      <h6>The service industry has been hit the hardest by this pandemic.<br></br>
        Many workers are out of jobs and struggling to pay bills. <br></br>
        There are many ways in which the Government is helping, for example they are paying 80% of their salaries up to Â£2500. 
        Which is why I have decided to try and help top their wages up by 20% with this site. This is a top up and not a new salary
